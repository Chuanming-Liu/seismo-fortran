This file contains outline information about each module contained in the repo.
For more information about what the modules do, please look in the code.


EC_grid
-------
Designed for handling models where sets of elastic constants are arranged on a
cartesian grid.  Deals with files describing the models which are stored in a
custom binary format for speed and size.


EC_grid_assumed_int
-------------------
As above, but for grids where the coordinates can be assumed to be in integers
(useful for some problems and reduces file complexity).


FFFTW
-----
Modern Fortran 2003 wrapper for the FFTW3 fourier transform library
(http://www.fftw.org).  It removes the need for quite a bit of surrounding code
to create complex traces when transforming real ones.  (The name is short for
'Fastest Fortran Fourier Transform in the West')


anisotropy_ajn
--------------
Deal with generally-anisotropic elastic constants, including calculate seismic
velocities in anisotropic media, create constants with certain symmetries, and
more.  Meant to offer feature parity and similar calling convention to the
popular MSAT Matlab toolbox (http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/MSAT/)


constants
---------
Contains physical and Fortran real precision constants.  Much neglected.


density_1d
----------
Density of a few seismic 1D Earth models.  Much neglected.


f90sac
------
Deal with date in the Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) format.  Written by James
Wookey (see source for licence).


get_args
--------
Get command line arguments with relatively little fuss.


global_1d_models
----------------
Get properties of varous seismic 1D Earth models, including pressure, density,
velocity, and so on.


mod_raypaths
------------
Describe and manipulate sets of numbers which describe the paths of rays in
the Earth.


moment_tensor
-------------
Seismic moment tensor manipulation, including produce the radiation pattern
from an arbitrary moment tensor.


plate_motion
------------
Use some current (absolute) plate motion models (e.g., NUVEL1A-HS3, MORVEL) to
calculate absolute and relative plate motions on Earth.


spherical_geometry
------------------
Convert from, to and between cartesian, spherical and geographic coordinate
systems on the sphere.


spherical_splines
-----------------
Fit and evaluate data on the sphere using spherical splines with variable
spacing.


splitwave
---------
Forward model shear wave splitting along defined raypaths.


statistical
-----------
Assortment of statistical functions, including circular statistics.


timing
------
Simple routines to make timing your Fortran codes easier.
