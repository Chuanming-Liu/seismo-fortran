About
-----
This repo contains Fortran modules which I have adapted or written for use in
my geophysics work, primarily dealing with seismic anisotropy.


Installation
------------
A Fortran and C compiler are needed.

The modules can be statically compiled directly into your own code like this:

    $ $FC -o program module.f90 program.f90

Typing `make' in the root directory builds the modules as shared and static
libraries.  Edit the Makefile to reflect the compiler and options you need.


Site specific notices
---------------------
The code has been developed using gfortran/gcc on Mac OS X, so some idiosyncracies
of this platform may have crept in, though I've tried to make everything as
portable as possible.  Current portability issues are as follows:

. plate_motion.f90:  This won't compile with the Cray compilers, complaining about
        the declaration of type parameters.  I don't know if this is a bug in
        the compiler, or a violation of the standard.  A workaround is to simply
        not build this module if you don't need it.
. On ARCHER, when running any programs on the head node, you will see when using
        the Cray compilers:
            LIBDMAPP WARNING: Unable to open kgni version file 
            /sys/class/gemini/kgni0/version errno 2
        This is because the Cray communication libraries have been linked in but
        are not accessible to serial programs on the head nodes.  You can silence
        this (harmless) warning by compiling with
            -target=local_host
